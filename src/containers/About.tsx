    <h2>About Barry</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Barry.  I'm a longtime fullstack developer with a focus on back end systems and system intercommunication.  I've done a lot of API integrations, custom software systems, data storage and data stream manipulation, process communication, and a whole ton of other odds and ends along the way.</p>
    <p>Oh, and that little robot guy I use for all my avatars comes from some obscure old Japanese comic book cover I randomly found doing google image searches for pulp art.  I'm probably infringing on someone's copyright.  If so, please let me know.</p>
  </div>;
